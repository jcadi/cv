    <p>To Whom it may concern,</p>

    <p> Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and my resume.</p>

    <p> I am writing to you in response to the position advertised in your company and I would like to be considered for
        that role. I am now looking for a new and exciting opportunity that encompasses all of my gained knowledge and
        skills and I believe that I fulfil all of the requirements. After spending the last 8 years working in the
        United Kingdom I would be happy to relocate to other city or country if it was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my time in the UK, I have gained outstanding communicative and organizational skills, whilst developing a
        strong attention to detail. This opportunity has also enabled me to achieve a high level of English language,
        both written and spoken. </p>

    I am currently working in Booking.com as Operations and Product Support Executive, managing and liaising
    reservations with global suppliers network, mainly in Spain, Europe and LATAM countries, as well as providing
    advice, support and alternatives to our customers.

    In my previous job, as an account manager, I was responsible for a portfolio of Spanish and Portuguese speaking
    clients as well as development of new opportunities for the business. Key roles include problem resolution, business
    development, credit control, management of CRM software and a sales pipeline.

    <p> As you can see from my CV, previously I was employed as a Customer Service Supervisor for a multinational web
        based company, where I helped to expand into the Spanish market through sales of online courier services. Duties
        included managing a team of five agents, general account management, reporting, dispute resolution, updating
        meetings, and budget management.

    </p>
    <p> Before relocating to the UK I worked at the highest level both in local government and also within the private
        sector in Spain. I held the position of Managing Director for public parking services for the city of Leon for
        eleven years, where I gained a diverse range of skills including negotiation and signing of contracts and
        agreements with Trade Unions, project management, and accountability for budgets and people.
    </p>
    I am a highly driven, pragmatic and organized individual with the ability and desire to learn, adapt and thrive in
    the face of challenge and change. I am creative, alert, and highly self-motivated. Always results orientated, my
    natural ease around people at all levels allows me to easily and effortlessly sell ideas or products and to maintain
    good relationships with customers.</p>

    <br> Thank you for considering me for this role and I hope that I will be given the opportunity to elaborate on my
    experience and my suitability at an interview. I look forward to hearing from you.
    </p>
    <p> Yours faithfully, </p>
    <p>Julio Calvo</p>
